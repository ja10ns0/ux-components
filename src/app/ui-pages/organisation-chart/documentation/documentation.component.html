          This component is built with only ul and li tags of html and css code. To add the drag effect we used an Angular library "ngx-drag-scroll", (https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-drag-scroll). To use it, once the library has been imported into the project, put the <span class="documentation-code">drag-scroll</span> label on the item you want to drag.
