      Netex Material UI Library uses its own style guide that allows us to customize our components. This style guide has css classes "helpers" with the most used styles that will help you to design your components more easily.

      In this page we show you the classes of colours that allow you to easily set the background of an element <span class="documentation-code">.utils--bc-*</span>. Background utilities do not set color, so in some cases youâ€™ll want to use <span class="documentation-code">.utils--text-*</span> utilities.
